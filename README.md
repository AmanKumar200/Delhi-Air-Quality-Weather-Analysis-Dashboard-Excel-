## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Air Quality & Weather Analysis Dashboard** designed to deliver actionable environmental insights for Delhi. The dashboard consolidates hourly air pollution and meteorological data—covering AQI, PM2.5, PM10, and key weather parameters—into a single, interactive Excel view. It enables policymakers, researchers, and citizens to understand pollution trends, identify high-risk locations and time periods, and assess the impact of weather conditions on air quality for data-driven public health awareness and monitoring.

## ❓ Business Questions & KPIs

This dashboard answers critical environmental and public-health-related questions using well-defined KPIs.

### 📌 Key Questions Addressed

1. **What is the overall air quality status in Delhi?**  
   → *KPI:* Average AQI

2. **Which locations have the worst air quality on average?**  
   → *KPI:* Average AQI by Location

3. **At what time of day does air pollution peak?**  
   → *KPI:* Hourly AQI Trend

4. **How frequently does Delhi experience Severe or Very Poor air quality?**  
   → *KPI:* AQI Category Distribution (% Severe / Very Poor)

5. **How does humidity impact PM2.5 levels?**  
   → *KPI:* Average PM2.5 by Humidity Range

6. **How does wind speed influence PM2.5 concentration?**  
   → *KPI:* Average PM2.5 by Wind Speed Range

7. **Which locations show the highest pollution volatility?**  
   → *KPI:* AQI Variability (Standard Deviation) by Location

8. **When are conditions unsafe for outdoor activities?**  
   → *KPI:* Count of Severe AQI Hours by Time of Day

## 📌 Project Insights

- Anand Vihar and Okhla Phase III consistently record the highest AQI and PM2.5 levels.  
- Air pollution peaks during early morning and late evening hours.  
- Higher humidity levels are associated with increased PM2.5 concentration.  
- Increased wind speed helps disperse pollutants and reduce PM2.5 levels.  
- A significant portion of observations fall under Very Poor and Severe AQI categories, indicating frequent health risks.  

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

To effectively address air pollution in Delhi, data-driven monitoring focused on high-risk locations and peak pollution hours is essential. The analysis shows that weather conditions—particularly humidity and wind speed—play a crucial role in influencing PM2.5 levels. Proactive alerts during high-risk periods, location-specific interventions, and public awareness initiatives can help mitigate health impacts and support better urban air quality management.
